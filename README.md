This is where it all starts... well kinda


I was in the 7th or 8th grade... cant remember, and my uncle and friend David and I were trying to learn iOS programming from [an iTunes U class from Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/downloads-2011-fall). I don't remember if we ever ended up finishing that course, but I learned a lot.

The homework for the class was that you step by step made this big iOS card game and by the end of the course, you had a pretty cool app. This is our attempt at that app. I haven't looked at the code recently, but I'm sure that it's moldy Spaghetti (also its for iOS old.old.x, so even if it compiled the last time I checked in, it would be pretty hard to get modern xCode to compile it (if you do though, let me know it would make me laugh)).
